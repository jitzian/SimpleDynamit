# DYNAMIT: MOBILE DEVELOPER CODE PROMPT

Write a native app (iOS or Android) that consumes data from from the open air quality API
( https://docs.openaq.org/ ) and displays it to the screen.
Display a listing of the city names and number of measurements that are available for that city. Do
not show any cities that have less than 10,000 measurements. The listing should be sorted
descending by number of measurements. The app should use the most efficient way possible to
filter and sort the data.
Along with a display for the list, a user should be able to tap one of the locations and open a
detail view that includes additional information about the location/measurement.
Additionally, the app should be able to handle connectivity issues gracefully
